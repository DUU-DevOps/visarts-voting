-- Updated Solution --

1. Timestamp is included. Operates on a 24 hour clock i.e. 3 PM is 15:00
2. Added alert that all fields must be inputted correctly. Data will only be sent to database if all fields are valid. Initially set values to empty strings rather than null to prevent errors with Firebase as well. 
3. Averages have been added to database as voteAvg field.
4. Votes, number of voters, and average score has been added to the spreadsheet
