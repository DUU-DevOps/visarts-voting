I knew I wanted to create a piece featuring a pineapple, because it would allow me to work in hexagonal tessellations and organic material. The Hopf fibration stood out as a perfect application for pineapple scales because I wanted something that would have parallels to the bands seen in the fibration, and pineapples provided that.",

Here we use a python implementation to create a stochastic generative algorithm that simulates these murmurations. Introducing velocity rules, collision avoidance, circularly evading prey, and other properties allow this emergent system to trace complex patterns over time. The paths traced represent the attraction of multiple pairs of birds in the flock as they move overtime. Each of the murmuration patterns represents an increasingly weighted prey attraction parameter and longer pursuit left to right and the colors are randomly sampled from images of tropical flocking birds.\n",

    "description" : "At the center of the Oglesby family structure was Annie Oglesby. For years, I marveled at my inspirational grandmother who, despite her inability to hear, successfully raised four kids within the public housing communities of Dayton, Ohio. Her house was the connection which brought the family together, her cooking made in that way that only your grandmother could. It was her strictness, her love, and her dedication that made her house a home, for my father and for me. We just came up on the third anniversary of her passing in February, an annual event that seems to displace all of us. I painted this picture for my dad for Father's Day, in loving memory of my grandmother. As a tribute to her life and the home she created, my father usually has this painting set upon a shrine next to her photo, some roses, and her ashes. And in tribute to her legacy, he has allowed me to share it with those at Duke. ",

    "description" : "MURMURATIONS\nLuke Farrell\nJake Shulman\n\nThis work is inspired by the murmurations formed by Startling birds -- a classically emergent system found in nature. Here we use a python implementation to create a stochastic generative algorithm that simulates these murmurations. Introducing velocity rules, collision avoidance, circularly evading prey, and other properties allow this emergent system to trace complex patterns over time. The paths traced represent the attraction of multiple pairs of birds in the flock as they move overtime. Each of the murmuration patterns represents an increasingly weighted prey attraction parameter and longer pursuit left to right and the colors are randomly sampled from images of tropical flocking birds.\n",

The screenprint mimics the repeated images portrayed in the media that Americans are equally desensitized to. Similarly   Squirrelyn Monroe   in a more lighthearted approach  presents a desensitization of students to the countless squirrels on Duke s campus and perhaps the squirrels  desensitization to us.",

Most of the representation Indians receive in Western media is misrepresentation. Therefore  I found some comfort in hip hop and urban culture  which are built on representation and authenticity. They gave me a way to navigate my cultural surroundings and eventually became a significant part of my identity.   On my path to cultural reconciliation and healing  I ve found blending aspects of my various identities to be therapeutic. I wanted to explore the relationship between Hindu deities and our perception of them. In typical Hindu shrines  most of them are portrayed in a grandiose manner   draped in jewelry and vibrant Indian clothing in front of a colorful background. By adding pieces of streetwear to photos of these deities and removing some ornaments  I wanted them to represent my cultural existence. I also wanted to explore how replacing more ancient signs of wealth with contemporary signs of wealth would influence my perception of these deities.  ",
